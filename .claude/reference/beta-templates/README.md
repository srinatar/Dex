# Dex Beta Features

You found the experimental features! These are capabilities I'm testing with a small group of beta testers before making them available to everyone.

## Why Beta Test?

I want to make sure new features actually work well and don't break anything before rolling them out. Beta testers help me:

- Find bugs and edge cases
- Understand what's confusing
- Prioritize what to build next
- Make sure it works across different setups

## Current Beta Features

### Pi Integration (v0.1.0)
**Status:** Active beta

Pi is a self-extending AI coding agent that lets you build custom tools for your Dex system. Instead of waiting for me to build features, you describe what you need and Pi builds it for you.

Example use cases:
- "Build me a tool that tracks commitments from my meeting notes"
- "Create an alert when any P0 task is more than 2 days old"
- "Make a weekly dashboard showing how my time aligns with my pillars"
