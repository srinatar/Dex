# Dex System

Documentation about how Dex works and why.

## What Goes Here

- **Dex_Jobs_to_Be_Done.md** — Why the system exists, what problems it solves
- **Dex_System_Guide.md** — Comprehensive guide to using Dex effectively
- **Integrations/** — Setup guides for external tools (Granola, Pendo, etc.)

## Purpose

This folder contains the "why" and "how" of Dex itself. When you forget how something works or want to understand the design philosophy, start here.

## Key Documents

- **Jobs to Be Done** — Understand what problems Dex solves and when to use each feature
- **System Guide** — Complete walkthrough of workflows, commands, and best practices
- **Dex Power User Cheatsheet** — Quick reference: commands and when to use them
- **Jira & Confluence Setup** — Push Dex project status to Confluence pages and Jira
- **Google Calendar Setup** — Direct Google Calendar MCP integration
- **Integration guides** — Connect external tools to enhance Dex

## Maintenance

These docs are living documents:
- Updated when the system changes
- Refined based on user feedback
- Expanded as new features are added

If you find gaps or unclear sections, mention them and Dex will update the docs.
